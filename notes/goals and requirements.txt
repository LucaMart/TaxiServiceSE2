Constraints
-----------

1. Passengers can access to the service through mobile or web application
#. Taxi driver can use the system only with mobile application
#. Taxi driver must have a GPS to share his location with the system
#. Both Passengers and Taxi driver must be connected to the netowrk to access the service (too obvious?)
#. Each taxi driver is in charge of exactly one taxi vehicle

Further observation
-------------------

1. G5 "Receive the fee amount he need to pay in case of a shared ride" is actually a requirement
#. Modify G4: a shared ride must be available even without having reserved it first (aka Sharing on demand)
