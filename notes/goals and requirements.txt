Goals and requirements
======================

Goals
-----

1. The user must be able to:

    1. Transmit its position and the desired destination to the system, thus initiating
    the request of a taxi
    #. Access the system from both a in-browser and a mobile application (?)
    #. Receive the code and the ETA of the incoming taxi
    
        **Assumption:** in case the taxi queue is empty, the system will query the
        adjacent zones
        
    #.
