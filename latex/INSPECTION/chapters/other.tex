There is a repeated improper use of \textit{for} loops with iterators, in the form:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java, breaklines=true]
  for (Iterator patterns = aServlet.getUrlPatternsSet().iterator(); patterns.hasNext();)
\end{lstlisting}


From line 142 to line 182, the third level statement " if" doesn't follow the right standard indentation\\

However, it might just be following the project's internal coding style
