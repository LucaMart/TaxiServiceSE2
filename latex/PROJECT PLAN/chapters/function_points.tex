In order to evaluate the cost of the project we have to identify 
the function points and estimate the complexity of each one.
To each point we assign a weight referring to this table:\\

\begin{tabular}{ | c | l | l | l |}
    \hline
     Function types & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Weight} \\\hline
       & Simple  & Medium & Complex \\ \hline
    External Input & 3 & 4 & 6   \\ \hline
    External Output & 4 & 5 & 7 \\ \hline
    External Inquiry & 3 & 4  & 6 \\ \hline
    Internal Logic File & 7 & 10 & 15 \\ \hline
    External Interface File & 5 & 7 & 10  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
  \item{\makebox{Internal Logic File\hfill}: users (guest, taxidriver and passenger), 
                               ride, sharedride, taxiqueue}
  \item{\makebox{External Interface File\hfill}: gps coordinates, map service}
  \item{\makebox{External Input\hfill}: login, logout, request, reserve, delete, reserve shared,
                         accept call, refuse call, report, taxi available,
                         taxi not available, change settings}
  \item{\makebox{External Output\hfill}: message (eta, no taxi message)}
  \item{\makebox{External Inquiry\hfill}: see profile, see active ride list}
\end{itemize}


\section{Complexity and cost evaluation}
  \subsection{Internal Logic File}
  According to our previous specification (explained in the RASD and DD documents),
  \textbf{users} and \textbf{ride} have to store few informations, thus we can adopt the
  simple cost weight for those ones.
  On the other hand, \textbf{sharedride} and \textbf{taxiqueue} have to store a dynamic
  list, that require more attention, so we adopt a medium cost weight.
  \begin{equation}
   4*7 + 2*10 = 48 \text{ FPs}
  \end{equation}

  \subsection{External Interface File}
  The interactions with \textbf{gps} coordinates and the \textbf{map service} are very simple, 
  because we need to gather few information from them, so we adopt a simple weight for
  both of External Internal Files.
  \begin{equation}
   2*5 = 10 \text{ FPs}
  \end{equation}
  
  \subsection{External Input}
  Most of the external inputs are simple actions involving a few number of entities,
  therefore we can adopt a simple weight cost for them.
  \textbf{request} and \textbf{change settings} however are more complex, and thus require a medium weight cost.
  \begin{equation}
    10*3 + 2*4= 38 \text{ FPs}
  \end{equation}
  
  \subsection{External Output}
  Sending \textbf{eta} requires to access the map service that calculate, on its own,
  the appropriate value, so we adopt a simple cost weight for message.
  \begin{equation}
    2*4 = 8 \text{ FPs}
  \end{equation}
  
  \subsection{External Inquiry}
  \textbf{see profile} requires only to send some fields saved in the current user,
  while \textbf{see active ride} list requires to scan the ridehistory and check its status (active or not).
  Therefore, we adopt a simple cost weight for the former, and a medium cost weight for the latter.
  \begin{equation}
    1*3 + 1*4 = 7 \text{ FPs}
  \end{equation}
  
  \subsection{Overall}
  In summary we have $\text{FPs} = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \text{FP}i = 111 $
