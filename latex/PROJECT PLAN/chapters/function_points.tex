In order to evaluate the cost of the project we have to identify 
the function points and estimate the compleaxity of each one.
\begin{itemize}
  \item [Internal Logic File]: users (guest, taxidriver and passenger), 
                               ride, sharedride, taxiqueue
  \item[External Interface File]: gps coordinates, map service
  \item[External Input]: login, logout, request, reserve, delete, reserve shared
                         accept call, refuse call, report, taxi available,
                         taxi not available, change settings
  \item[External Output]: message (eta, no taxi message)
  \item[External Inquiry]: see profile, see active ride list
\end{itemize}

\section{Complexity and cost evaluation}
  \subsection{ Internal Logic File}
  According to our previous specification ( explained in RASD and DD documents)
  users and ride have to store few information, for these we can adopt the
  simple cost weight, while sharedride and taxiqueue have to store a dynamic
  list, that require more attention, so we adopt a medium cost weight.
  %TODO aggiungere il calcolo dei costi seguendo i dati presi dalla tabella
  \subsection{External Interface File}
  The interaction with gps coordinates and the map service is very simple, 
  because we needs few information from them, so we adopt a simple weight for
  both of External Internal Files.
  %TODO aggiungere la formula
  \subsection{External Input}
  \subsection{External Output}
  Sending eta requires to access the map service that calculate ,by his own ,
  the needed value, so we adopt a simple cost weight for message.
  %TODO aggiungere la formula
  \subsection{External Inquiry}
  See the profile requires only to send some fields saved in the current user,
  for this External Inquiry we adopt a simple cost weight, while the active
  ride list requires to scan the ridehistory and check its status ( actived or
  not), we adopt a medium cost weight for this.
