In order to evaluate the cost of the project we have to identify 
the function points and estimate the complexity of each one.
To each point we assign a weight referring to this table:\\

\begin{tabular}{ | c | l | l | l |}
    \hline
     Function types & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Weight} \\\hline
       & Simple  & Medium & Complex \\ \hline
    External Input & 3 & 4 & 6   \\ \hline
    External Output & 4 & 5 & 7 \\ \hline
    External Inquiry & 3 & 4  & 6 \\ \hline
    Internal Logic File & 7 & 10 & 15 \\ \hline
    External Interface File & 5 & 7 & 10  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [Internal Logic File]: users (guest, taxidriver and passenger), 
                               ride, sharedride, taxiqueue
  \item[External Interface File]: gps coordinates, map service
  \item[External Input]: login, logout, request, reserve, delete, reserve shared,
                         accept call, refuse call, report, taxi available,
                         taxi not available, change settings
  \item[External Output]: message (eta, no taxi message)
  \item[External Inquiry]: see profile, see active ride list
\end{itemize}
\section{Complexity and cost evaluation}
  \subsection{ Internal Logic File}
  According to our previous specification ( explained in RASD and DD documents)
  users and ride have to store few information, for these we can adopt the
  simple cost weight, while sharedride and taxiqueue have to store a dynamic
  list, that require more attention, so we adopt a medium cost weight.\\
(1) 4x7 + 2x10=48 FPs
  \subsection{External Interface File}
  The interaction with gps coordinates and the map service is very simple, 
  because we needs few information from them, so we adopt a simple weight for
  both of External Internal Files.\\
(2) 2x5= 10 FPs
  \subsection{External Input}
  All external inputs are simple action that involves a few number of entities,
  we can adopt a simple weight cost for all of them.\\
 (3) 12x3=36 FPs
  \subsection{External Output}
  Sending eta requires to access the map service that calculate ,by his own ,
  the needed value, so we adopt a simple cost weight for message.\\
(4) 2x4= 8 FPs
  \subsection{External Inquiry}
  See the profile requires only to send some fields saved in the current user,
  for this External Inquiry we adopt a simple cost weight, while the active
  ride list requires to scan the ridehistory and check its status ( actived or
  not), we adopt a medium cost weight for this.\\
(5) 1x3 + 1x4= 7 FPs

In summary we have FPs= $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{5} FPi$ = 109
