\begin{itemize}
  \item[Maven]: As a platform to manage builds and dependencies
  \item[JUnit]: For the implementation of unit tests it's an obvious choice,
    given its integration with the major IDEs and the overall simplicity and familiarity for the developers
  \item[Arquillian]: For the integration testing phase, we have chosen this
    tool, since it easily integrates with Maven and JUnit, and presents speed and simplicity as its defining traits
\end{itemize}
