\section{Purpose}
This document aims to describe, specify and analyze the software requirements for \textit{My Taxi Service}. \\
My Taxi Service is needed to provide a passenger-friendly interface to interact with the city's taxi service, and ensure
a fair management of the city-wide taxi deployment.

\section{Scope}
The passengers should be able to use an application (either mobile or browser based) to request a taxi through the system,
which in turn should answer with the ETA \footnote{Estimated time of arrival} and identification code of the incoming tax. \\
The taxi drivers should be able to use a mobile application to communicate their availability to the system, and accept incoming
calls. \\
The system shall manage a queue of taxis for each taxi zone \footnote{partition of the city}. \\
The system shall receive GPS location data from each taxi, and use that information to assign each taxi to a 
taxi zone; an available taxi is automatically placed into the taxi queue belonging to the taxi zone it currently occupies. \\
The system shall remove a taxi from the queue upon receiving a confirmation in which the driver accepts an incoming call; a
further confirmation is also sent back to the driver. If a taxi (driver) does, on the other hand, refuse an incoming call, the system
shall move it to the bottom of its taxi queue. \\
The system shall provide an Application Programming Interface, to make room for future improvements.
