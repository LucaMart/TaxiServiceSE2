\section{Purpose}
This document aims to describe, specify and analyze the software requirements for \textit{My Taxi Service}. \\
My Taxi Service is needed to provide a passenger-friendly interface to interact with the city's taxi service, and ensure
a fair management of the city-wide taxi deployment.

\section{Scope}
%TODO: (michele) Here I will used some terms that are specific in the context of the project...
% Should I make a reference to the appropriate definition in section "Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations"?
% I have added some footnotes though
The passengers should be able to use an application (either mobile or browser based) to request a taxi through the system,
which in turn should answer with the ETA and identification code of the incoming tax. \\
The passengers should be compelled to provide their current location to the system, for their request to be accepted. \\
The taxi drivers should be able to use a mobile application to communicate their availability to the system, and accept
 or refuse incoming calls. \\
The system shall manage a queue of taxis for each taxi zone\footnote{Partition of the city}. \\
The system shall receive GPS location data from each taxi, and use that information to assign each taxi to a 
taxi zone; an available taxi is automatically placed into the taxi queue belonging to the taxi zone it currently occupies. \\
The system shall remove a taxi from the queue upon receiving a confirmation in which the driver accepts an incoming call; a
further confirmation is also sent back to the driver. If a taxi (driver) does, on the other hand, refuse an incoming call, the system
shall move it to the bottom of its taxi queue. \\
The system matches a passenger's position to a taxi zone, and uses that information to forward the call to the first taxi
available in the relative taxi queue. \\
The system shall provide an Application Programming Interface, to make room for future improvements.
% TODO: (michele) part II and III
\section{Goals}
The passengers must be able to:\\
\begin{itemize}
 G1. Transmit its position and the desired destination to the system, thus initiating the Request of a taxi
    G2. Receive the code and the ETA of the incoming taxi\\
    G3. Reserve a taxi for a certain time\\
    G4. Request a shared ride\\
    G5. Receive the fee amount he need to pay in case of a shared ride\\
The taxi driver must be able to:\\
    G6. Answer a passenger request\\
    G7. Render him/herself available to the scheduler\\
    G8. Render him/herself unavailable to the scheduler\\
    G9. Receive informations about the fees of the passengers in case of shared ride\\
The system must be able to:\\
   G10.Offer a programmatic interface to enable the development of additional services\\
\end{itemize}
\section{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
Passenger: the person who needs to call a taxi.\\
(?)System: the automatic part that manages the service.\\
