\section { Functional Requirements}
 
For each goal, we define the specific function that we will have to implement;\\
\begin {itemize}
\item [G1]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Passengers can select from a menu the option of requesting a taxi as soon as possible; 
	\item Passengers can insert their position filling an input form and confirm it;
	\item The system will receive the request and identify the zone in which the passenger is in;
	\item The system will forward the request to the first taxi in the selected zone queue and wait for an answer;
	\item If the taxist accepts, the system will remove him from the queue; otherwise it will append the taxist to the last position and
scan the list for a taxist to accept;
	\end{itemize}
\item [G2]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item As soon as a taxist accepts a request, the system invokes the support system to calculate the ETA giving the position of the taxi and the position of the passenger;
	\item The system will communicate the taxi code and the ETA;
	\end{itemize}
\item [G3]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Passengers can select from a menu the option of reserving a taxi for a chosen ride and date; 
	\item Passengers can insert the initial and final position, time and date, their email and confirm it;%account or not?<---we need to talk about this, cause withouth an account, some villain could request  taxis withouth taking it, taxi-drivers may react like --> >.< fuck this technology! #?!*§!
	\item The system will receive the reservation and if it respects the 2 hour constraint it will send a confirmation;
	\item Ten minutes before the ride starts, the system allocates a taxi for it.
	\end{itemize}
\item [G4]:% we need an account for this, otherwise a Passengers could requests infinite number of shared ride, and pay 0 bucks 
% shared ride available only for reserved ride? ( Add the corresponding assumption)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The application must have a selectable option labled:"share your ride", that allows passengers ,who reserved a ride, to enable the shared ride service.
	\item When the system receive a request of a shared ride, it will search for others shared ride requests starting from the same taxi zone, and going in the same direction %TODO decide by ourselves or ask  the "customer" what does "same direction" mean
	\item When a new passenger is added to a shared ride, the system will interact with the map service, in order to retrieve a new route for the taxi driver, and to calculate new fees
	\item After the taxi allocation, the passengers who requested the shared ride will receive, not only the taxi ID, but also the fee they have to pay.
	%I assumed that a shared ride can be selected only in case of reserved ride....
	\end{itemize}
\item [G5] % <<< I don't think that it is an actual goal

\item[G6]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item When a request comes or there is a reservation for the next 10 minutes without an assigned taxi driver, the system must search for the first queued taxi and forward him the request.
	\item If a taxi driver refuse to take care about a call, the system will move him at the end of the queue, and forward the request to the next taxi driver in the queue. If a queue is empty, the system will search a taxi driver in a queue belonging to an adiacent taxi zone % What all taxi driver refuse to take care of a certain call, infinite loop?.....and also: If there are more than one adiacent zones, how to decide which to choose? 
	\end{itemize}
\item [G7]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item
	\end{itemize}
\end {itemize}
