\section { Functional Requirements}
 
For each goal, we define the specific function that we will have to implement;\\
\begin {itemsize}
\item [G1]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Passengers can select from a menu the option of requesting a taxi as soon as possible; 
	\item Passengers can insert their position filling an input form and confirm it;
	\item The system will receive the request and identify the zone in which the passenger is in;
	\item The system will forward the request to the first taxi in the selected zone queue and wait for an answer;
	\item If the taxist accepts, the system will remove him from the queue; otherwise it will append the taxist to the last position and
scan the list for a taxist to accept;
	\end{itemize}
\item [G2]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item As soon as a taxist accepts a request, the system invokes the support system to calculate the ETA giving the position of the taxi and the position of the passenger;
	\item The system will communicate the taxi code and the ETA;
	\end{itemize}
\item [G3]:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item  Passengers can select from a menu the option of reserving a taxi for a chosen ride and date; 
	\item Passengers can insert the initial and final position, time and date, their email and confirm it;%account or not?
	\item The system will receive the reservation and if it respects the 2 hour constraint it will send a confirmation;
	\item Ten minutes before the ride starts, the system allocates a taxi for it.
	\end{itemize}
\item [G4]:\\
