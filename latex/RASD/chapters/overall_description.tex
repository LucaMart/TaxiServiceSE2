\section{Product perspective}
The system must interact with a map service, to retrieve information about the route to send to the taxi driver in case of shared ride.


\section{Constraints}
We will develop a unique mobile application that can be used by both passengers and taxi-drivers.\\
The web application will include only passengers functions.\\
The mobile application must be available for Android, Windowsphone and iOS.\\


\section{User characteristics}
The users must be connected to the network to use the application.
Passengers can interact with the service through a web browser or a mobile application.\\
Taxi driver must access to the application with a device provided of GPS.


\section{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If a request comes from a zone, whose queue is empty, then the system forwards the call to the first taxi in the queue corresponding to an adjacent taxi zone, starting from the northeast.
  \item A passenger doesn't need an account to request a taxi, however, an account is required to use the reservation service. %team discussion--->confirm/change this assumption
  \item Taxi drivers can create only one account per vehicle ID %<--Targa
  \item Passengers who reserve a taxi can delete the reservation; if a taxi was allocated for the ride, the system will notify the taxi driver and put him at the top of the queue.
  \item
\end{itemize}
