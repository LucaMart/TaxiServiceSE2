\section{Purpose}
This document aims to describe, specify and analyze the software requirements for \textit{My Taxi Service}. \\
My Taxi Service is needed to provide a passenger-friendly interface to interact with the city's taxi service, and ensure
a fair management of the city-wide taxi deployment.

\section{Scope}
%TODO: (michele) Here I will used some terms that are specific in the context of the project...
% Should I make a reference to the appropriate definition in section "Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations"?
% I have added some footnotes though
The passengers should be able to use an application (either mobile or browser based) to request a taxi through the system,
which in turn should answer with the ETA and identification code of the incoming tax. \\
The passengers should be compelled to provide their current location to the system, for their request to be accepted. \\
The taxi drivers should be able to use a mobile application to communicate their availability to the system, and accept
 or refuse incoming calls. \\
The system shall manage a queue of taxis for each taxi zone\footnote{Partition of the city}. \\
The system shall receive GPS location data from each taxi, and use that information to assign each taxi to a 
taxi zone; an available taxi is automatically placed into the taxi queue belonging to the taxi zone it currently occupies. \\
The system shall remove a taxi from the queue upon receiving a confirmation in which the driver accepts an incoming call; a
further confirmation is also sent back to the driver. If a taxi (driver) does, on the other hand, refuse an incoming call, the system
shall move it to the bottom of its taxi queue. \\
The system matches a passenger's position to a taxi zone, and uses that information to forward the call to the first taxi
available in the relative taxi queue. \\
The system shall provide an Application Programming Interface, to make room for future improvements. \\
The system shall also provide the possibility of requesting the reservation of a taxi; said reservation must occur at least
2 hours before the actual time of the ride; the time of the ride has to be specified by the passenger during the
reservation procedure, as well as the passenger's location and destination. \\
However, the system will actually allocate a taxi (by means of removing it from the queue) only 10 minutes before the
requested time of the ride.
% TODO: (michele) part III
\section{Domain properties}
In this section we will analize the background laying behind My Taxi Service:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users of the service are assumed to be reliable and trustworthy, meaning that if they request a taxi or make a reservation
they will declare their real position and actually use the taxi;\\
\item Users of the service will pay at the end of the ride the amount of money demanded by the taxist;\\
\item Taxi drivers must own a valid taxi driving license;\\
\item ETA is estimated with a maximum error margin of 5 minutes;\\
\item We assume that for each zone if its queue is empty there is at least one queue in the eight adjacent zones with available taxis;\\
\item We assume GPS coordinates reliable;\\
\end{itemize}
\section{Goals}
The passengers must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [G1] Transmit its position and the desired destination to the system, thus initiating the Request of a taxi
  \item [G2] Receive the code and the ETA of the incoming taxi
  \item [G3] Reserve a taxi for a certain time  % TODO: this sounds kinda ambiguous, i.e. "this taxi is mine for xx time"
  \item [G4] Request a shared ride
  \item [G5] Receive the fee amount he need to pay in case of a shared ride
\end{itemize}
The taxi driver must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [G6] Answer a passenger's request
  \item [G7] Render him/herself available to the scheduler
  \item [G8] Render him/herself unavailable to the scheduler
  \item [G9] Receive informations regarding the fee defined for each passenger in case of shared ride
\end{itemize}
The system must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item [G10] Offer a programmatic interface to enable the development of additional services
\end{itemize}
\section{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
\begin{description}
  \item[Passenger:] the user who sends a taxi request.
  \item[System:] the automatic part that manages the service.  % (?) <- add doubts/TODOs as comments pls----> is that the right definition?
  \item[ETA:] estimated time of arrival.
  \item[Taxi zones:] geographical partitions of the city, non overlapping, with an average size of 2Km\textsuperscript{2}.
  \item[Queue:] a list of all available taxis in the corresponding taxi zone. It is managed as a FIFO queue.
    There is exactly one taxi queue associated to each taxi zone.
  \item[GPS:] global position system.
  \item[Shared ride:] a passenger shares the ride with other people that origins from the same zone, and go to the same direction
    % TODO: what is "same direction"? Maybe "same destination"? <--- direction was mentioned in the Assignments, we have to contact the customer

\section{Product perspective}
The system must interact with a map service, to retrieve information about the route to send to the taxi driver in case of shared ride.
\section{Constraints}
We will develop a unique mobile application that can be used by both passengers and taxi-drivers.\\
The web application will include only passengers functions.\\
The mobile application must be available for Android, Windowsphone and iOS.\\
\section{User characteristics}
The users must be connected to the network to use the application.
Passengers can interact with the service through a web browser or a mobile application.\\
Taxi driver must access to the application with a device provided of GPS.
\section{Assumption}
\begin{itemize}
<<<<<<< HEAD
\item If a request comes from a zone, which queue is empty, the system forwards the call to the first taxi in the queue corresponding to an adiacent taxi zone, strartin from the northest.
\item A passenger doesn't need of an account to reserve a taxi, unless he wants to add a reservation.%team discussion--->confirm/change this assumption
\item Taxi drivers can create only one account per vichle ID %<--Targa
\item Passengers who reserve a taxi can delete the reservation, if a taxi was allocated for the ride, the system will notify the taxi driver and put him at the top of the queue.
\item Passengers go in the same direction if at least one of the following constraints is true: 
\begin{itemize}
\item one destination is included in in the path generated to reach the others
\item 
\end{itemize}
=======
  \item If a request comes from a zone, whose queue is empty, then the system forwards the call to the first taxi in the queue corresponding to an adjacent taxi zone, starting from the northeast.
  \item A passenger doesn't need an account to request a taxi, however, an account is required to use the reservation service. %team discussion--->confirm/change this assumption
  \item Taxi drivers can create only one account per vehicle ID %<--Targa
  \item Passengers who reserve a taxi can delete the reservation; if a taxi was allocated for the ride, the system will notify the taxi driver and put him at the top of the queue.
